# Get your Tezos Smart Contracts production-ready

So you want to write a smart-contract for the [Tezos blockchain](https://www.tezos.com)? You're at the right place!

## Requirements
This toolset is entirely based on [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

You can download Docker Desktop for your OS at https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop. When download is ready, you can proceed to install it.

Same goes for Node.js, for which we suggest the LTS version for your system at https://nodejs.org/.

## Getting started
To use this toolset, just open a Terminal and type:

```sh
npx create-tezos-smart-contract
```

This will guide you through the basic setup of the environment to start coding your contracts right away.

## Usage
[Created repository's README](./contract-bundle/README.md) will guide you over the entire toolset.

## Features
- Smart Contract(s) repository setup with just 1 command
- [**LIGO Compiler**](https://ligolang.org), dockerized, at the version you like (default version is LIGO latest release)
- **[Flextesa](https://gitlab.com/tezos/flextesa) local Sandbox environment**, dockerized, to run Tezos test networks (node) at any version up to **Hangzhou**
- [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io), with a proper setup to write both unit and E2E tests with [Taquito](https://tezostaquito.io)
- [**Deploy UI**](https://github.com/uconomy/tezos-builder-suite), designed to make your life easier. Helps you build your initial storage and lets you deploy in sandbox, testnet or mainnet. Works with faucet accounts and the Beacon SDK, to let you choose your preferred wallet for signing

## Why?
Because we wanted Tezos development to follow a full process to release great production-ready software: coding, compiling, unit testing, end-to-end testing (both local and on Tezos testnet) and full fledged deploy on mainnet with all the available wallets.

## Why a toolset?
Tezos ecosystem now offers a lot of different tools to code, compile, test and interact with Smart Contracts. The problem is that sometimes you need to install software directly on your machine, sometimes you're prompted to use Docker and sometimes you might end up just with a big mess of separate tools which is also difficult to maintain and update as the Tezos protocol releases come out.

With `lava` we'll bring together the latest updates of every single tool for you, you just need to use our last version.

## Why not Truffle?
[Truffle](https://www.Trufflesuite.com) offers one of the easiest ways to develop Tezos Smart Contracts. However, there were several choices in Truffle that made us decide to develop our own toolchain:
- The usage of a custom Docker-image sandbox (not aligned with Tezos updates)
- The inability to control your development flow in detail (contracts compiled every time no matter what you needed)
- The usage of a custom library to write tests, not standard
- The usage of a custom library to interact with Tezos contracts in tests, not documented, you'd end up writing less tests because no documentation could be found on how to code them
- Truffle was born with Ethereum in mind. Let's be honest: all the Truffle toolset with UI is great for Ethereum, but the lack of it for Tezos makes it seem more like a less-maintained adapted version of Truffle instead of a genuine Tezos toolset
- And, last but not least, Truffle's dedicated Tezos branch is still full of Ethereum content. This made us decide not to contribute to that codebase, but rather to start a new and clean one, always open source.

## Supported development Tezos protocols
- Ithaca
- Hangzhou

__Hangzhou is the default Sandbox protocol version__, but you can easily use Ithaca by editing `protocol` in the `sandbox` section of `config.json` in your Contracts' repo:
```jsonc
{
    // ...some other settings
    "sandbox": {
        // ...
        "protocol": "ithaca",
        // ...
    },
    // ...
}
```

Might work also with earliers version of the protocol, but we highly discourage working on such versions as you may end up with less features, higher costs and even bugs.
